##

#
# User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
# used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
# as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
# number may be used.
#
{% if tinp.User is defined %}
User {{ tinp.User }}
{% endif %}
{% if tinp.Group is defined %}
Group {{ tinp.Group }}
{% endif %}

#
# Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
# that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
# to start tinyproxy using root.
#
{% if tinp.Port is defined %}
Port {{ tinp.Port }}
{% endif %}

#
# Listen: If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to
# only one. If this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all
# interfaces present.
#
{% if tinp.Listen is defined %}
Listen {{ tinp.Listen }}
{% endif %}

#
# Bind: This allows you to specify which interface will be used for
# outgoing connections.  This is useful for multi-home'd machines where
# you want all traffic to appear outgoing from one particular interface.
#
{% if tinp.Bind is defined %}
Bind {{ tinp.Bind }}
{% endif %}

#
# BindSame: If enabled, tinyproxy will bind the outgoing connection to the
# ip address of the incoming connection.
#
{% if tinp.BindSame is defined %}
BindSame {{ tinp.BindSame }}
{% endif %}

#
# Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
# allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
#
{% if tinp.Timeout is defined %}
Timeout {{ tinp.Timeout }}
{% endif %}

#
# ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error
# occurs.  You will probably need to customize the location to your
# particular install.  The usual locations to check are:
#   /usr/local/share/tinyproxy
#   /usr/share/tinyproxy
#   /etc/tinyproxy
#
{% if tinp.ErrorFile is defined %}
{% for errNum,errFile in tinp.ErrorFile.iteritems() %}
ErrorFile {{ errNum }} "{{ errFile }}"

{% endif %}

#
# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
# HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
# that has occured.
#
{% if tinp.DefaultErrorFile is defined %}
DefaultErrorFile "{{ tinp.DefaultErrorFile }}"
{% endif %}


#
# StatHost: This configures the host name or IP address that is treated
# as the stat host: Whenever a request for this host is received,
# Tinyproxy will return an internal statistics page instead of
# forwarding the request to that host.  The default value of StatHost is
# tinyproxy.stats.
#
{% if tinp.StatHost is defined %}
StatHost {{ tinp.StatHost }}
{% endif %}

#
# StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
# for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
# hardcoded in tinyproxy.
#
{% if tinp.StatFile is defined %}
StatFile "{{ tinp.StatFile }}"
{% endif %}

#
# Logfile: Allows you to specify the location where information should
# be logged to.  If you would prefer to log to syslog, then disable this
# and enable the Syslog directive.  These directives are mutually
# exclusive.
#
{% if tinp.Logfile is defined %}
Logfile "{{ tinp.Logfile }}"
{% endif %}

#
# Syslog: Tell tinyproxy to use syslog instead of a logfile.  This
# option must not be enabled if the Logfile directive is being used.
# These two directives are mutually exclusive.
#
{% if tinp.Syslog is defined %}
Syslog {{ tinp.Syslog }}
{% endif %}

#
# LogLevel: 
#
# Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
#	Critical	(least verbose)
#	Error
#	Warning
#	Notice
#	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
#	Info		(most verbose)
#
# The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
# LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
# Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.
#
{% if tinp.LogLevel is defined %}
LogLevel {{ tinp.LogLevel }}
{% endif %}

#
# PidFile: Write the PID of the main tinyproxy thread to this file so it
# can be used for signalling purposes.
#
{% if tinp.PidFile is defined %}
PidFile "{{ tinp.PidFile }}"
{% endif %}

#
# XTinyproxy: Tell Tinyproxy to include the X-Tinyproxy header, which
# contains the client's IP address.
#
{% if tinp.XTinyproxy is defined %}
XTinyproxy {{ tinp.XTinyproxy }}
{% endif %}

#
# Upstream:
#
# Turns on upstream proxy support.
#
# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
#
# For example:
#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
#  no upstream ".internal.example.com"
#  no upstream "www.example.com"
#  no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
#  no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
#  no upstream "."
#
#  # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
#  upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
#  upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"
#
#  # default upstream is internet firewall
#  upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80
#
# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
# can use a host, or a domain:
#  name     matches host exactly
#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
#  IP/mask  matches network/mask
#
#Upstream some.remote.proxy:port

{% endif %}

#
# MinSpareServers/MaxSpareServers: These settings set the upper and
# lower limit for the number of spare servers which should be available.
#
# If the number of spare servers falls below MinSpareServers then new
# server processes will be spawned.  If the number of servers exceeds
# MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.

# StartServers: The number of servers to start initially.
#
{% if tinp.StartServers is defined %}
StartServers {{ tinp.StartServers }}
{% endif %}

#
# MaxRequestsPerChild: The number of connections a thread will handle
# before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which
# disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
# leakage, then set this to something like 10000.
#
{% if tinp.MaxRequestsPerChild is defined %}
MaxRequestsPerChild {{ tinp.MaxRequestsPerChild }}
{% endif %}

#
# Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any
# access control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise,

# tested against the controls based on order.
#
{% if tinp.Allow is defined %}

#
# AddHeader: Adds the specified headers to outgoing HTTP requests that

# traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what headers are exchanged.
#
{% if tinp.AddHeader is defined %}
{% for headerTitle,headerValue in tinp.AddHeader.iteritems() %}

#
# ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
# the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
# is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
# Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
#
{% if tinp.ViaProxyName is defined %}
ViaProxyName "{{ tinp.ViaProxyName }}"
{% endif %}

#
# DisableViaHeader: When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add
# the Via header to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into
# stealth mode. Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the Via
# header, so by enabling this option, you break compliance.
# Don't disable the Via header unless you know what you are doing...

#
# FilterDefaultDeny: Change the default policy of the filtering system.
# If this directive is commented out, or is set to "No" then the default
# policy is to allow everything which is not specifically denied by the
# filter file.
#
# However, by setting this directive to "Yes" the default policy becomes
# to deny everything which is _not_ specifically allowed by the filter
# file.
#
{% if tinp.FilterDefaultDeny is defined %}

#
# Anonymous: If an Anonymous keyword is present, then anonymous proxying
# is enabled.  The headers listed are allowed through, while all others
# are denied. If no Anonymous keyword is present, then all headers are
# allowed through.  You must include quotes around the headers.
#
# Most sites require cookies to be enabled for them to work correctly, so
# you will need to allow Cookies through if you access those sites.

# ConnectPort: This is a list of ports allowed by tinyproxy when the

# If you uncomment the following two directives and run tinyproxy
# on your own computer at port 8888, you can access Google using
